# What is this project's goal?
The goal of this project is to give people a better understanding of spigot and java.

# What can I learn from this?
You can learn how to use config files in a minecraft plugin and use those to read and write values from them.

# How did I make this?
* I made a project in IntelliJ with the spigot preset provided by the Minecraft Dev plugin for IntelliJ.
* I made a command class for the command that toggles the spawnblocker.
* I wrote the code that listenes to if a mob spawns
* I wrote code that takes all entities specified in the config file and compares them to the one that spawned.
* If the spawned mob is on the list, then it won't spawn.
